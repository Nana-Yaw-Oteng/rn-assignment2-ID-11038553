* The task involved setting up a react native environment and creating a react native app by running commands such as 
`npm install -g expo-cli ` which was used to create the environment and `npx create-expo-app <my project name>` and changing the directive to the project.
* I changed the background color of the app by changing the color in the stylesheet. I also changed the font size by using in-line styling in the Text component and boldening my name using the Text component around my name and doing in-line styling.
